# RUX
Recipient Seamless User Experience Portal:
The Grants QSMO is excited to engage industry in market research for our Recipient Seamless User Experience (RUX) Portal via a request for information (RFI)! See the official document attached for more details. The Grant QSMO is seeking industry input related to full lifecycle information technology (IT) systems integration support to develop the Grants QSMO RUX Portal via the NITAAC (National Institutes of Health Information Technology Acquisition and Assessment Center) CIO-SP3 Small Business GWAC. Any questions can be directed to Kelly.lael@nih.gov at NITACC.
 
We've developed a clickable prototype of the Grants QSMO RUX Portal, which can be viewed in this demo: https://lnkd.in/djmmbhSp
